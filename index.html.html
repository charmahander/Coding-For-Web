  A legend on and off the mic, there's no one more revered in modern day sonic finesse than <strong>Kid Cudi</strong>, 
  is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer and actor from Cleveland, Ohio.
  He has been recognized as an influence on several hip hop and alternative acts throughout the years.

      Before his rise to fame, Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi on January 30, 1984, in Cleveland, Ohio, and grew up in Shaker Heights and Solon. He is the youngest of four children, with two brothers, Domingo and Dean, and a sister, Maisha. 
      He was mainly of African-American descent. <br><br>
      When he was 11 years old, Cudi's father died of cancer; his passing had a significant effect on Cudi's personality and subsequently his music.
      He studied film at the University of Toledo, but dropped out after a year.<br><br> 
      He couldn't join the Navy because of his juvenile record so since he was already rapping towards the end of school, he decided to move to New York city to pursue a music career and stayed with his uncle.
      He worked in a BAPE store where he ultimately met Kanye West.

        Cudi contributed to Alternative Hip-Hop during the 2000s by giving ode to his inspirations such as Jimi Hendrix, Kanye West, Paul Simon, Outkast, and J. Dilla, and became
        one of Hip-Hop’s most influential and unique artists. He’s known for his atmospheric take on melodic rap and his ability to openly show his insecurities and frailties on record. 
        He’s different from other rappers. The good kind.<br><br>

        His new progression caught the eye of Kanye West, who later signed Cudi to his label - GOOD Music. But what really caught the attention of listeners and musicians was Cudi’s way with words and his expressiveness.
        Much like earlier music on mental health from vets like Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G, and the Geto Boys, Cudi unravels his struggles with his own issues.
        Cudi was the first artist to really have that style of Hip-Hop, so I was drawn to how different it sounded compared to everything else,
        he spoke a lot about depression and anxiety in his songs which many related. His on-going advocacy regarding mental health illnesses and issues propelled his music further.<br><br>

        Cudi’s bars are simply and authentically his. At times, he would sing off key or use songs from other genres in his music. He’s experimental and open. 
        He wasn’t afraid to go above and beyond the traditional Hip-Hop tropes, which made him the influential artist that he is despite what some might think of him now.

    For me, rap and hip-hop is an escape from reality, just like it was for Cudi. Thought I got into his discography very late in life, I'm still glad I found his music.<br>
